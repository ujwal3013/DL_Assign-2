* **Transfer Learning has been implemented for predicting type of cancer by using InceptionV3 as a pretrained model and Chest CT Scan Image Dataset has been used to train the pretrained model.**
* **The last 15 layers of the pretrained model have been finetuned.**
* **The model has achieved a training accuracy of 84.2% and a validation accuracy of 75.9%.**
* **The model could successfully predict the type of cancer for the given image from test data.**
